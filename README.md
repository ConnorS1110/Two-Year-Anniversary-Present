My anniversary present for my girlfriend of 2 years.
A simple snake game with a twist. Random power-ups will spawn,
but a question about our relationship must be correctly
answered, or the player is punished.

## Known Issues

-   Window will randomly freeze when touching taco or power-up occasionally, requiring a full restart of the window (Fixed _I think_ as of v1.2)
-   Power-up icon doesn't properly despawn from UI if you touch 2 power-ups before the animation for the first disappears (Fixed as of v1.3.1)
