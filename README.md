My anniversary present for my girlfriend of 2 years.
A simple snake game with a twist. Random power-ups will spawn,
but a question about our relationship must be correctly
answered, or the player is punished.

## Known Issues

- Window will randomly freeze when touching taco or power-up occasionally, requiring a full restart of the window (Fixed *I think* as of v1.2)
